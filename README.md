GitHub's rendering of Jupyter Notebooks has limitations, and unfortunately, it doesn't fully support the interactive nature of Plotly and SHAP graphs directly within the static preview.

Please use this url address in order to see the plotly graphs for the notebook **Military Power Clustering**

How to share your jupyter notebooks on nbviewer?
 1. copy the link address your notebook in github. Example:    
    `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY/blob/main/notebook.ipynb`
 2. Replace github.com with raw.githubusercontent in the URL.    
    `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY/blob/main/notebook.ipynb`
 3. Remove /blob/ from the path.    
    `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY/main/notebook.ipynb`
 4. Once you have the raw file link, you can paste it into nbviewer.org.
